# netflix-and-guest-stars-in-office

In this project, I will solve a real-world data science problem. 
I will use everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib to discover if Netflix's movies are getting shorter over time 
and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office"

After performing an exploratory analysis, the **question** is that "Are movies getting shorter?"

Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children's movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot (Figure-3.png). But we can't know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Now the **answer** is "no" or "maybe"
